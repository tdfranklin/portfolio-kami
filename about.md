My name is Tyler D. Franklin and I am a passionate Full Stack Web Developer.  For more than a decade I worked on the hardware side of things and held various jobs as Network/Server Administrator or PC Technician, but a couple years ago I realized that I just wasn't satisfied with my career.  In 2016, I decided to make the jump to software development and it's been the best decision of my life.  I have finally found a passion that I was missing in my old career and I look forward to learning and growing in this ever-expanding field.  It's certainly never dull!  If you're interested, you can learn more about my journey into programming [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-03-my-journey-to-programming %}).

I am now currently enrolled in [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io).  It's quite an interesting journey and I'm learning so much, but you can read more about that [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-03-starting-bloc-pt1 %}).

I'm 33 years old and married to my beautiful wife, Holly, for almost 10 years.  We have two amazing children - Zoey and Jude, 9 and 1.  We currently live in Clinton, MS but are planning on moving to Denver, CO this summer.  Along with my passion for programming, I also have several other hobbies, including gaming (both video games and board games) and also I'm working on painting the miniatures for several of my board games.
