  <section class="post-content"><p>About a year or so before I started this course (Bloc), I realized I was not happy with the path my career was taking.  I was on the hardware side of IT (server/network admin, pc repair, etc) for more than 10 years, but it just wasn’t something I enjoyed.  I had always had an interest in learning programming, but never was sure where to start.  So in about August or September of 2016 I decided I wanted to check it out and see if it was something I was interested in doing.</p>

<p>So I enrolled in a free class on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python at Coursera</a> and went through several of the classes there.  I found myself facinated with the code and the ability to create.  I knew within a few weeks that I had pretty much wasted the last 10 years of my life and that this was what I wanted to be doing.</p>

<p>Now, at almost 32 years old, I knew I needed something drastic to be able to pivot my career and trying to take part-time classes to get a degree wouldn’t cut it.  I am married with two children, however, so I still have to provide for them as well.  So I started reading about programming boot camps, where in just a matter of a few months they turn you from no experience to a job-ready web developer.  I realized that I couldn’t afford to quit my job and pay to go to an on-site boot camp, so when I started researching online options, I quickly found Bloc.</p>

<p>I did a lot of reaearch about the program and decided it was the best choice for me.  So in December of 2016 I signed up for the program and opted to wait until late January to officially start the course so that I could prepare.  I didn’t want to go into the program completely green, so I found some other free courses online for basic Javascript and Ruby and spent the next month cramming as much into my head as possible.  Everything from HTML/CSS to basic command line usage to Git…. it was a tough few weeks, but I really feel like it paid off.</p>
